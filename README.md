# Design Guidelines

(i.e. Use the exact colors, fonts, and spacing as shown in the mockups).

# Contributing Guidelines

Our primary branch is `main` so when starting any new features please branch from there.
Branch names should follow the convention of `username/short-description(-###)`. Where ###
is the number of the issue you are working (if applicable). In order to merge your changes,
you will have to open a pull request against main, resolve all feedback conversations, and
get at least 1 approval from another developer.

### Step-By-Step

1. Branch off `main` with naming convention `username/short-description(-###)` (ex. `matthewdeguzman/initial-framework-1`).
2. Work feature (don't worry about a clean history too much).
3. Make a PR against main (make sure the title is a clean commit message https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).
4. Receive feedback and resolve all conversations.
5. Get at least one approval.
6. Squash and Merge (if you believe your working history is valuable then just Merge).
